# Identity Module

This module provides user onboarding and authentication.

- **Token management** – Issue and revoke API tokens with TTL support.
- **KYC verification** – Accept document uploads and allow admin approval.

See the [Design Doc](../identity_module_design.md) and [Implementation Plan](../identity-implementation-plan.md) for architectural details. API usage is covered in the [Authentication guide](../authentication.md#identity-api-endpoints).
