# CCXT FastAPI Webhook Documentation

Welcome! This site provides documentation for the **CCXT FastAPI Webhook** project.
Most of the content mirrors the repository's `README.md`.

Use the navigation pane to explore the README or deployment guide.

To share these docs from a remote server (e.g. Heroku) you can run:

```bash
mkdocs serve -a 0.0.0.0:8000
```

This project also publishes the static site to GitHub Pages on each push to `main`.
