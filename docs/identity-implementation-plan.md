# Identity Module Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the highâ€‘level steps required to implement the `app.identity` module based on the [design document](identity-module-design.md).

## 1. Database Setup
- Create migrations for the `users`, `api_tokens`, `kyc_verifications` and `kyc_documents` tables.
- Ensure secure hashing for passwords and API tokens.

## 2. User Registration
- Implement registration endpoints with email verification.
- Support social and demo account flows.
- Add profile CRUD operations.

## 3. Token Management
- Build API token issuance, listing, revocation and permission update endpoints.
- Add rate limiting and audit logging for token use.

## 4. KYC Workflow
- Allow document upload with encrypted storage.
- Implement KYC submission status tracking and admin review endpoints.
- Integrate basic OCR validation hooks.

## 5. Admin Controls
- Expose endpoints for listing and approving pending KYC requests.
- Provide compliance reports as described in the design.

## 6. Security
- Enforce HTTPS and add optional MFA during token creation.
- Validate file uploads and apply virus scanning.

## 7. Testing
- Unit tests for registration, token handling and KYC transitions.
- Integration tests covering the full user onboarding flow.

## 8. Documentation
- Keep API reference and user guide up to date with new endpoints.

This sequence can be broken down into sprints aligned with the [Sprint Backlog](../SPRINT_BACKLOG.md).
