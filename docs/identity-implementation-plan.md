# Identity Module Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the highâ€‘level steps required to implement the `app.identity` module based on the [design document](identity_module_design.md). The design introduces role-based access control (RBAC) in addition to token and KYC workflows, so the implementation tasks below include those features.

## 1. Database Setup
- Create migrations for the core tables: `users`, `api_tokens`, `kyc_verifications` and `kyc_documents`.
- Add RBAC tables: `roles`, `permissions`, `role_permissions`, `user_roles` and `permission_audit_log`.
- Ensure secure hashing for passwords and API tokens.

## 2. User Registration
- Implement registration endpoints with email verification.
- Support social and demo account flows.
- Add profile CRUD operations.

## 3. Token Management
- Build API token issuance, listing, revocation and permission update endpoints.
- Support role-restricted tokens and token usage analytics.
- Add rate limiting and audit logging for token use.

## 4. Role-Based Access Control
- Implement CRUD endpoints for roles and permissions.
- Add assignment endpoints for user roles and role permissions.
- Introduce permission-checking middleware with audit log entries.

## 5. KYC Workflow
- Allow document upload with encrypted storage.
- Implement KYC submission status tracking and admin review endpoints.
- Integrate basic OCR validation hooks.

## 6. Admin Controls
- Expose endpoints for listing and approving pending KYC requests.
- Provide compliance reports as described in the design.
- Include user management and role assignment features.

## 7. Security
- Enforce HTTPS and add optional MFA during token creation.
- Validate file uploads and apply virus scanning.
- Enforce least-privilege role assignments and periodic role cleanup.

## 8. Testing
- Unit tests for registration, token handling, RBAC logic and KYC transitions.
- Integration tests covering the full user onboarding and admin flows.

## 9. Documentation
- Keep API reference and user guide up to date with new endpoints and RBAC examples.

This sequence can be broken down into sprints aligned with the [Sprint Backlog](../SPRINT_BACKLOG.md).
