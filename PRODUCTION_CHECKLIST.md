# 📘 Production-Grade Webhook Design Principles

## ✅ Security
- [x] Authenticate requests using HMAC signature or token fallback
- [x] Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
- [x] Secure environment-based secret management
- [x] Implement rate limiting or IP whitelisting (optional enhancement)

## ✅ Reliability
- [x] Graceful error handling with FastAPI HTTP exceptions
- [x] Close exchange connections (ccxt.async_support)
- [x] Cache exchange sessions for reuse of loaded markets
- [x] Health check endpoint
- [x] Implement retry logic or circuit breaker pattern for exchange errors

## ✅ Scalability
- [x] Use FastAPI for async I/O
- [x] Use ccxt.async_support for non-blocking order placement
- [ ] Support background queueing (Celery, RQ) for high-latency orders (future)

## ✅ Maintainability
- [x] Modular structure (routes, auth, exchange, config, utils)
- [x] Use Pydantic models for validation
- [x] Centralized logging setup
- [x] Config management using Pydantic Settings
- [ ] Add docstrings and inline comments throughout

## ✅ Observability & Deployment
- [x] Structured logging
- [x] Heroku-compatible Procfile and runtime.txt
- [x] .env-driven configuration
 - [x] Integrate external monitoring (e.g., Sentry, Prometheus)

# 🧩 Project Backlog (To-Do List)

## 🔐 Security
- [x] Add optional API key authentication layer
- [ ] Consider token expiration and replay protection via nonce

## 💥 Error Handling
- [x] Add unit tests for signature/timestamp failures
- [x] Handle specific CCXT exceptions with retry/circuit-breaker logic

## 🧪 Testing
- [ ] Add full test coverage for webhook endpoint
- [x] Mock CCXT responses in unit tests
- [ ] Test token mode and HMAC mode separately

## 📊 Logging & Monitoring
 - [x] Add structured log output for DataDog/ELK compatibility
 - [x] Integrate with a monitoring platform (Heroku Metrics or external)

## 🔁 Background Jobs (Advanced)
- [x] Add support for background task queue (e.g., Celery)
- [x] Async enqueue-to-worker architecture for non-blocking execution

## 📄 Documentation
- [ ] Add inline docstrings for all utility and route functions
- [ ] Generate OpenAPI schema and add `/docs` link in README
- [ ] Include Postman collection for webhook usage
